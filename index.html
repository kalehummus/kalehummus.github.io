<p>Hello yes. I am Nidhi Subi Shah. You may know me as Nidhi, Subi, or simply "That annoying woman who won't stop posting things on her twitter account. I should unfollow her but she's just so damned funny."</p>
<p>I'm currently working on a herself-help called something like <i>Business Bitch</i> or something equally as idiotic, so watch out for it soon. I got the idea for this when I went to a Plastics conference and kept being talked down to, so I wanted to write a book on business. Do I have a background in business? Of course not! But all businesspeople got their start knowing nothing about business. I have a hashtag on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/subizdev?f=tweets&vertical=default&src=hash"></a>#subizdev</a> that I frequently provide kernels of business knowledge. You should check it out. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I'm also a classically trained mechanical engineer who makes stuff.</p>
<p>You should hire me to do mechanical design for you</p>
<p>contact me at nsubishah on the top e-mail site for millenials.</p>
